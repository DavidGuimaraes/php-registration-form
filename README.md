# PHP Registration Form

This project is part of the exercises done on the last refresh marathon of the PHP programming language. It consists of a HTML form styled with Twitter Bootstrap and validation done within the same page with pure PHP. The PHP code in within the same file and the form submits the data to the same page/file so validations can be done.
